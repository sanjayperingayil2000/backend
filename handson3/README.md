There are two types of middleware in Express.js: universal middleware and individual middleware.

Universal middleware is a middleware function that is defined outside of a specific route. It is executed for every request to the server, 
regardless of the HTTP method or the URL path of the request. Universal middleware is useful for tasks that need to be performed for every request, 
such as logging, authentication, and parsing the request body.

Individual middleware, on the other hand, is a middleware function that is defined within a specific route. 
It is executed only for requests that match the route path and HTTP method. Individual middleware is useful for tasks that are specific to a particular route, 
such as validating the request data or accessing data from a database.
